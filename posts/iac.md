**If it's not code, it doesn't exist.**

I don't think of myself as a self-hoster. I just hate undocumented systems.

If a configuration isn't described as code — it doesn't exist.
If a change can't be reproduced from scratch — it was an accident, not a decision.

Running Proxmox + PBS at home isn't about the cool factor. It's about practicing production-grade discipline in an environment where mistakes are cheap.

The skills transfer directly. The habits transfer even more.

At work, undocumented changes hide for quarters. At home, they detonate overnight.

I know which one teaches faster.
